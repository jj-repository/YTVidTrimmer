## Instructions for Your Friend

### Step 1: Extract the Archive
```bash
tar -xzf YoutubeDownloader-Linux.tar.gz
cd YoutubeDownloader-Linux/
```

Or just right-click the file and select "Extract Here" in your file manager.

### Step 2: Run Setup (checks dependencies)
```bash

```

This will check if `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` are installed, and show the exact command to install them if needed.

```

Or just double-click the `YoutubeDownloader` file.

## What's Inside the Archive

- **YoutubeDownloader** - The main executable (14 MB)

## Sharing the File

You can share `YoutubeDownloader-Linux.tar.gz` via:
- Email attachment
- File sharing services (Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer, etc.)
- USB drive
- Cloud storage

## Note

The app will:
- Save downloads to `~/Downloads` by default

- Use space-efficient encoding (H.264/AAC)

Your friend doesn't need to know Python, set up virtual environments, or deal with any technical setup!
